<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Congratulations for having successfully built Anushri!</p>
<p>Anushri is a monophonic synthesizer with an all-analog signal path,
paired with a lo-fi digital drum synthesizer. These two sections are
controlled by an on-board sequencer/arpeggiator, featuring generative
drum pattern sequencing. Anushri is open to the modular world thanks to
its analog patching area.</p>
<h3 id="panels-and-controls">Panels and controls</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../../static/images/anushri_panel.png" /></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. The upper group of knobs and switches controls the analog sound
synthesis. The signal "flows" from left to right: VCO, mixer, VCF. Most
of these knobs are directly interacting with the analog audio signal (no
latency, no stepping... but no MIDI control).</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>. The lower group of 10 knobs can serve multiple functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing the remaining parameters of the synth.</li>
<li>Setting sequencer/arp/MIDI keyboard options.</li>
<li>Controlling the drum synth and drum sequencer.</li>
</ul>
<p>These 3 different "pages" can be activated by the first column of
buttons labelled <strong>Synth</strong>, <strong>Clk/Kbd</strong> and <strong>Drums</strong>. One of the three
LEDs in the vertical column indicates the current page.</p>
<p>Note that if you intend to play Anushri as a synth, without the drum
machine and without experimenting with its sequencer, you can leave it
on the <strong>Synth</strong> page forever and enjoy a "1 knob per function" layout.
Even if you are using the sequencer and drum machine, you'll notice that
you rarely switch pages.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>. Output volume control.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>. Additional CV/Gate/Audio I/O for modular systems.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>. Indicator LEDs. The purpose of the LEDs is shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../static/images/anushri_leds_cheatsheet.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LFO</strong>. The brightness of this LED reflects the LFO value.</li>
<li><strong>Gate</strong>. This LED is lit when a key is held or when the gate input
    is high.</li>
<li><strong>Beat</strong>. This LED is lit when the steps 1, 5, 9, 13... of the step
    sequencer are active.</li>
<li>The 3 remaining LEDs indicate the active page, and thus the function
    of the lower group of knobs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>F</strong>. Switches. The first column of 3 switches is used to select the
active page. The second column of 3 switches controls the sequencer. The
<strong>Hold</strong> button serves a few additional functions when held and used as
a "shift" key - this will be revealed throughout this documentation.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong>, <strong>H</strong>. MIDI in and MIDI out.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong>, <strong>J</strong>. Audio out and Audio in. The input signal goes through the
VCF and VCA.</p>
<p><strong>K</strong>. On/Off switch.</p>
<p><strong>L</strong>. Power supply connector. A 7.5V or 9V DC supply must be used, with
a current rating above 200mA. The connector has a 2.1mm barrel, with a
positive center tip polarity. Most universal power supplies allow the
polarity to be selected â€” the polarity being often represented by a
diagram like this: â€“ (o <em>, or by the indication tip:</em>. Anushri's power
supply circuitry has a reverse polarity protection and can handle
voltages up to 12V. Above this, one of the chip inside the unit could be
destroyed by overvoltage.</p>
<h2 id="monophonic-analog-synthesizer">Monophonic analog synthesizer</h2>
<p>This section documents Anushri's analog synthesis section.</p>
<p>Anushri follows the classic subtractive synthesis scheme: a <strong>VCO</strong>
producing a rich waveform is filtered/colored by a <strong>VCF</strong>, and the
level of the resulting sound is controlled by a <strong>VCA</strong>. One
particularity of Anushri is that it also includes an additional digital
square wave generator. Even if this terminology is inaccurate, it'll be
referred to as the <strong>DCO</strong> in the rest of the documentation (For the
sake of accuracy: the square wave comes from a programmable interval
timer on the main MCU). This second source can be used to achieve sounds
traditionally reserved to dual oscillator synthesizers, such as FM,
hard-sync, or rich detuned sounds.</p>
<p>Anushri has 3 envelope generators: an <strong>AD</strong> envelope used for VCO and
PWM control; an <strong>ADSR1</strong> envelope used for VCF control; and an
<strong>ADSR2</strong> envelope used for VCA control. However, the user interface
does not allow individual editing of these envelopes: the <strong>AD</strong> and
<strong>ADSR1</strong> envelope share the same attack and decay settings; and
<strong>ADSR2</strong> is controlled through a morphing parameter which gives it the
shape of <strong>ADSR1</strong>, or an increasingly rigid shape resembling a Gate
signal.</p>
<p>Anushri has 2 LFOs: a main LFO, syncable to tempo, with 8 different
waveforms; and a vibrato/growl triangle LFO, the amplitude of which is
controlled by the modulation wheel.</p>
<p>All the synthesis parameters can be accessed from the front panel by
pressing the <strong>Synth</strong> button.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../static/images/anushri_panel_synth.png" /></p>
<h3 id="oscillator-section">Oscillator section</h3>
<p><strong>FM</strong> controls by which amount the DCO signal modulates the frequency
of the VCO. This modulation is linear FM. Dissonant and metallic timbres
can be achieved by setting <strong>FM</strong> to a high value, and by detuning the
DCO and VCO with the <strong>VCO range</strong> or <strong>VCO detune</strong> knobs.</p>
<p><strong>VCO mod</strong> controls which modulation is applied to the VCO. In central
position (the potentiometer has a detent at 12 o'clock), no modulation
is applied to the VCO. When turning the knob clockwise, an increasing
amount of LFO modulation is applied. When turning the knob
counter-clockwise, an increasing amount of AD envelope modulation is
applied.</p>
<p><strong>PW</strong> adjusts the pulse-width of the square waveform. In central
position (the potentiometer has a detent at 12 o'clock), the output
signal is a square waveform.</p>
<p><strong>PW mod</strong> controls the modulation applied to pulse-width. In central
position (the potentiometer has a detent at 12 o'clock), no modulation
is applied to the pulse width. When turning the knob clockwise, an
increasing amount of LFO modulation is applied. When turning the knob
counter-clockwise, an increasing amount of AD envelope modulation is
applied.</p>
<p><strong>Sync</strong> resets the cycle of the VCO every time the DCO completes a full
cycle. This works particularly well when the VCO is set to a higher
pitch than the DCO (high value of the <strong>VCO range</strong> pot), and when an
envelope or LFO modulation is applied to the VCO, for this ewwwwww
sound. Note that when the VCO has a lower pitch than the DCO, no sound
can be heard. This is a useful trick if you want to disable the VCO for
external signal processing!</p>
<p><strong>Glide</strong> adjusts the portamento time between consecutive notes. This
causes the pitch of the previous note to slowly slide towards the pitch
of the next note.</p>
<p><strong>VCO range</strong> adjusts the pitch of the VCO relatively to the note played
on the keyboard, from -12 semitones to +36 semitones. This potentiometer
is deliberately "steppy", with one step for each semitones, and a
dead-band at octaves (-12, 0, 12, 24, 36 semitones).</p>
<p><strong>VCO detune</strong> adjusts the VCO pitch on a fine scale, to create a slight
detuning effect between the VCO and the DCO.</p>
<p><strong>Mix</strong> controls the balance of the sawtooth and square waveshapers. In
center position, both waveshapes are mixed together. Fully turned
clock-wise, only the square wave can be heard. Fully turned
counter-clock-wise, only the sawtooth wave can be heard.</p>
<p><strong>Sub level</strong> controls the level of an additional signal added to the
mix. This signal is selected with the <strong>Sub</strong> switch, from one of these
3 sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>The DCO.</li>
<li>A square sub-oscillator running one octave below the VCO.</li>
<li>A square sub-oscillator running two octaves below the VCO.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that any pitch modulation applied to the VCO will also be applied
to the sub-oscillator; but due to the way the sub-oscillator
synchronizes its pitch to the VCO, interesting sync-like or
quantization/arpeggiation effects can be heard.</p>
<h3 id="filter-section">Filter section</h3>
<p>Anushri's filter is a 2-pole multimode filter based on the
State-Variable topology - a circuit made famous in the synth world by
the Oberheim SEM. The filter can self-oscillates smoothly when resonance
is set to high values.</p>
<p><strong>Cutoff</strong> adjusts the filter cutoff frequency, from 18 Hz to 22kHz.
Note that by default, filter cutoff frequency tracks the note played by
the keyboard (this can be disabled by sending a specific CC message to
Anushri).</p>
<p><strong>Resonance</strong> adjusts the filter resonance, progressively emphasizing
the frequencies in the vicinity of the cutoff frequency.</p>
<p><strong>VCF env mod</strong> controls the amount of ADSR1 modulation applied to
filter cutoff.</p>
<p><strong>VCF LFO mod</strong> controls the amount of LFO modulation applied to filter
cutoff.</p>
<p><strong>VCF mode</strong> selects the filter mode: low-pass, band-pass, or high-pass.</p>
<p>The audio input at the back of Anushri (6.35 jack) is routed to the
filter input, allowing external signals to be processed through the
filter, fuzz and VCA.</p>
<h3 id="fuzz">Fuzz</h3>
<p>The signal produced by the VCF can be sent to a fuzz circuit before
getting into the VCA. Switch the <strong>Fuzz</strong> control on for a nasty
overdriven sound.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../static/images/anushri_panel_synth.png" /></p>
<h3 id="lfo">LFO</h3>
<p><strong>LFO shape</strong> selects the waveform of the main LFO. The following shapes
are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Triangle.</li>
<li>Square.</li>
<li>Ramp up.</li>
<li>Ramp down.</li>
<li>Sample and hold. The LFO periodically takes a random value.</li>
<li>Bernouilli process. The LFO randomly switches between a high and low
    value. The rate of transition is affected by the rate parameter.</li>
<li>Smooth random process. A continuous random waveform made of lines
    with a randomly selected slope is generated. The higher the rate,
    the higher the digital manic pixie dream cat tweaks the knobs.</li>
<li>Noise. The LFO output is a white noise signal. In this case, the
    rate parameter of the LFO has no effect.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LFO rate</strong> adjusts the speed of the LFO. The LFO frequency ranges from
0.06 Hz (a full cycle takes 16s) to 100 Hz. Note that when the rate
setting is set to its minimum value, the LFO locks itself to the
sequencer/arpeggiator clock, so that the LFO accomplishes a full cycle
over a period of 4 beats. This synchronization is achieved through a PLL
- it might take a few beats before the LFO effectively locks to the
sequence.</p>
<h3 id="envelopes">Envelopes</h3>
<p><strong>Attack</strong> and <strong>Decay</strong> adjust the envelopes attack and decay time.
These settings affect both the AD envelope (VCO and PWM modulation) and
the VCF ADSR envelope. They might affect the VCA ADSR envelope too.</p>
<p><strong>Sustain</strong> and <strong>Release</strong> adjust the envelopes sustain level and
release time. These settings affect the VCF ADSR envelope, and might
affect the VCA ADSR envelope too.</p>
<p><strong>VCA env</strong> controls the shape of the VCA envelope. When this setting is
set to 0, the VCA envelope is the same as the VCF envelope - exactly
matching the A, D, S, R settings dialed on the four knobs. When this
knob is set to a middle position, the VCA envelope has a null attack, a
75% sustain, and half the decay and release times dialed on the
<strong>Decay</strong> and <strong>Release</strong> knobs. Finally, when this knob is set to the
maximum value, the VCA envelope gets turned into a "gate" signal, with
no attack, no decay and release, and a sustain at full level. Inbetween,
some "morphing" between the shapes is applied. Refer to the following
illustration:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../static/images/anushri_vca_env.png" /></p>
<p>One can think of this setting as a "VCA envelope solidity" parameter.
Note that when this control is set to the most extreme "gate" setting,
the envelope actually has a non-null but tiny release time (exaggerated
on the drawing). This prevents clicks when a note is released.</p>
<p>Technical note: the LFOs and Envelopes are digitally generated, using a
2.45kHz refresh rate and a 12-bit resolution DAC (with 16-bit internal
computations).</p>
<h3 id="vco-tuning">VCO tuning</h3>
<p>Anushri's saw-core VCO uses a temperature compensation scheme (published
by Osamu Hoshuyama) which makes it quite stable once the inside
temperature of the case has plateaued. A reset-time compensation scheme
(De Franco resistor) attenuates the flat detuning in the higher octaves,
allowing the VCO to track well over the 55 .. 1760 Hz range.</p>
<p>However, to reach these performances, the VCO needs calibration through
a set of two trimmers (Offset and V/Oct) at the back of the board.</p>
<p>To spare you this lengthy process, a software compensation can be
enabled that will instantly bias Anushri's internal CV conversion stage
to reach the right tuning. To enable this correction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that the <strong>Sync</strong> switch is at the <strong>Off</strong> position.</li>
<li>Hold the <strong>Hold</strong> button and press <strong>Run/stop</strong>. A short, faint
    arpeggio will be heard - this is the sound of Anushri trying to play
    several notes through the VCO and measuring their frequency in order
    to evaluate the VCO accuracy. After that, the VCO will be tuned.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can repeat this operation if the unit has been subjected to large
changes of temperature, or if you don't want to wait for the warm-up
period and want to start playing in tune immediately.</p>
<p>Enabling this software compensation has two side-effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The VCO will be off-tune when triggered from external CV signals.</li>
<li>The CV output will be "tailored" for Anushri's own VCO and won't
    strictly adhere to the V/Oct standard.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you intend to use Anushri with a modular setup where accurate V/Oct
compliance is necessary, it is recommended to disable software tuning
correction and take the time to trim the VCO. To disable software tuning
correction, hold the <strong>Hold</strong> button and press <strong>Rec</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="interfacing-with-modular-equipment">Interfacing with modular equipment</h3>
<p>Twelve 3.5 I/O jacks are present on the front-panel to interface
Anushri's signal processing chain with the outside world.</p>
<p>Note that Anushri's internal signals are 5V pp, to allow low-power
battery operation - thus, the signals at some audio outputs might need
amplification to reach the levels commonly found in modular equipment.
However, given that all external signal inputs are fed to virtual
grounds through resistors, there is no constraint on the input voltage
ranges (well, don't try sending mains voltage there of course!).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../static/images/anushri_jack_connectors.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Aux Audio in</strong> is an additional input for external signal processing.
It is activated by setting the <strong>Sub</strong> switch to the <strong>DCO</strong> position,
and can be attenuated by the <strong>Sub level</strong> control. The input impedance
is 100kÎ©.</p>
<p><strong>Audio out</strong> is Anushri's final audio output, unaffected by the volume
control.</p>
<p><strong>VCA CV in</strong> is added to the other VCA modulation sources (envelope and
velocity). This input has an impedance of 22kÎ©.</p>
<p><strong>Drums out</strong> is an individual output with the digital drum synth's
signal. Plugging a cable in this connector will remove this signal from
the global audio output.</p>
<p><strong>PW CV in</strong> is a CV input for pulse-width modulation. A signal applied
here overrides the setting of the <strong>PW</strong> knob on the front panel. This
input has an impedance of 15kÎ©.</p>
<p><strong>VCF CV in</strong> gets added to all the other modulation sources for cutoff
frequency. The scale is 1V/Oct. This input has an impedance of 200kÎ©.</p>
<p><strong>VCO CV in</strong> gets added to all the other modulation sources for VCO
frequency. The scale is 1V/Oct if the VCO has been correctly manually
calibrated. This input has an impedance of 200kÎ©.</p>
<p><strong>VCO CV out</strong> is the CV value produced by Anushri's internal
MIDI-&gt;CV converter. This CV value incorporates all the arpeggiation,
detuning, transpositions, LFO and envelope modulations applied to VCO
pitch. The scale is 1V/Oct if software VCO compensation is disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Gate in</strong> triggers the attack of the envelopes on raising edges, and
triggers the release of the envelopes on falling edges.</p>
<p><strong>Gate out</strong> raises to +5V when the envelopes are triggered, and falls
to ground level when the envelopes are released (either as a consequence
of <strong>Gate in</strong> triggering or from MIDI note on/off messages).</p>
<p><strong>Clock in</strong> can be used to tick Anushri's clock (used for the
arpeggiator, sequencer and drum machine) when it is set to external
sync. Pulses on this input are expected to have a +5V high level, and
last at least 2ms. The clock resolution can be set to either 24ppqn,
8ppqn, or 4ppqn. See the <strong>System configuration</strong> section.</p>
<p><strong>Clock out</strong> outputs a train of 2 ms-long pulses (+5V high level) at
each tick of the clock (be it the internal clock, an external MIDI
clock, or external triggers through the <strong>Clock in</strong> input).</p>
<h3 id="a-few-words-about-saving-and-memory">A few words about saving and memory...</h3>
<p>Anushri does not have a load/save function or presets. All settings from
the front panel are saved in internal memory and restored when the unit
boots. Because saving takes time - half a second during which the unit
freezes, and we don't want this to happen during a performance! - the
settings are written to persistent memory only after 15s of inactivity.
Thus, it is recommended to leave Anushri alone for this amount of time
before switching it off. When the settings are saved to persistent
memory, the column of 3 LEDs flashes.</p>
<p>If for any reason you want to revert Anushri to its factory settings,
power the unit on while holding the <strong>Run/stop</strong> button.</p>
<h2 id="sequencer-arpeggiator-and-advanced-synthesis-features">Sequencer, arpeggiator and advanced synthesis features</h2>
<h3 id="using-the-built-in-sequencer">Using the built-in sequencer</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../../static/images/anushri_seq_cheatsheet.png" /></p>
<p>Anushri is equipped with a sequencer with step-by-step recording, mostly
inspired by Roland's classic SH-101 and JX3-P sequencers.</p>
<p>A sequence can contain up to 128 steps. The duration of a step is one
sixteenth note (4 steps per beat). Each step can either contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>note</strong>, with optional accent and slide.</li>
<li>A <strong>rest</strong>, which indicates that this step is silent.</li>
<li>A <strong>tie</strong>, which indicates that the note triggered at the previous
    step is not stopped, but rather prolonged, during this step.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start recording a sequence, press the <strong>Rec</strong> button. The column of 3
LEDs lights up to indicate that the recording mode is active. The row of
3 LEDs will indicate the current step, as previously illustrated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Press a note on the MIDI keyboard to add it to the sequence.</li>
<li>Press <strong>Drums</strong> to input a rest in the sequence.</li>
<li>Press <strong>Hold</strong> to input a tie in the sequence.</li>
<li>Move the pitch bend lever (the position doesn't matter) before
    recording a note, and this note will be slid.</li>
<li>Move the mod wheel up (the position doesn't matter) before recording
    a note, and this note will be accented (boost of filter envelope
    modulation and velocity).</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, press <strong>Rec</strong> when you are done.</p>
<p>To play the sequence, press the <strong>Run/stop</strong> button. To stop playback,
press <strong>Run/stop</strong> again. When the unit is configured to use an external
clock, the sequencer can also be started/stopped by sending the
corresponding MIDI messages.</p>
<p>While a sequence is playing, the MIDI notes played on the keyboard will
transpose the sequence. C3 (MIDI note #60) will bring back the sequence
to its original tonality.</p>
<h3 id="arpeggiator-and-advanced-synthesis-features">Arpeggiator and advanced synthesis features</h3>
<p>Additional synthesis settings, along with arpeggiator and sequencer
options can be accessed by pressing the <strong>Clk/Kbd</strong> button.</p>
<p>The following parameters are now assigned to the knobs:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../static/images/anushri_panel_clkkbd.png" /></p>
<p>But first, one word of caution... Inadvertently changing some of these
parameters can have a drastic and disastrous effect during a
performance. Thus, when entering this page, the knobs are locked: the
parameter will not change until the position of the potentiometer
actually matches the current value of the setting it controls.</p>
<p>Let us take an example. The sequencer is currently running at 120 BPM.
Because you were tweaking the slide parameter in the synth section, the
first knob is currently at its minimal position. If you press
<strong>Kbd/Clk</strong> and start turning the first knob, the tempo won't
immediately jump to its minimal setting. Instead, Anushri will wait
until the position of the knob matches 120 BPM (middle position), and
from then, it will start having an effect. A few other machines
(including other Mutable Instruments products such as Shruthi and
Ambika) have a similar feature and call this the <strong>snap mode</strong>.</p>
<p>When a pot is locked, the left or right LED in the row of 3 indicates in
which direction you have to turn the pot to unlock it.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../static/images/anushri_snap_cheatsheet.png" /></p>
<p>Now back to the actual settings!</p>
<p><strong>Tempo</strong> controls the tempo of the sequencer/arpeggiator, from 40 to
240 BPM. When set to its minimal value, the internal clock is disabled
and an external clock is used. The external clock can come either from
the MIDI in, or from pulses on the <strong>Clock in</strong> jack.</p>
<p><strong>Swing</strong> controls the swing of the internal clock. Swing cannot be
applied to an external clock.</p>
<p><strong>Arp mode</strong> controls the mode and range of the arpeggiator. The options
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>OFF - arpeggiator is disabled.</li>
<li>Up 1 octave.</li>
<li>Up 2 octaves.</li>
<li>Down 1 octave.</li>
<li>Down 2 octaves.</li>
<li>Up &amp; down 1 octave.</li>
<li>Up &amp; down 2 octaves.</li>
<li>Random 1 octave.</li>
<li>Random 2 octaves.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arp pattern</strong> controls the rhythmic pattern of the arpeggiator. 6
patterns are available. When this control is at its minimum position, a
basic eighth note pattern is used.</p>
<p><strong>Arp acidity</strong> spices up the arpeggiator pattern by adding slides and
accents at strategic times, with a well-balanced amount of randomness.
The higher setting, the more likely slides/accents will be added.</p>
<p><strong>Octave</strong> acts as a global octave range control for both the VCO and
DCO.</p>
<p><strong>Master tune</strong> acts as a global fine tune control (with a range of +/-
1 semitones) for both the VCO and DCO.</p>
<p><strong>Vibrato rate</strong> controls the speed of the vibrato LFO. The amplitude of
this LFO is directly controlled by the modulation wheel of the MIDI
keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>Vibrato destination</strong> controls the destination of the vibrato LFO.
When this control is set to its minimum value, the vibrato LFO affects
the pitch (actual vibrato). When this control is set to its maximum
value, the vibrato LFO affects the cutoff frequency ("growl" or
"wah-wah" effect). In the middle position, both the VCO and VCF are
affected.</p>
<p><strong>Velocity destination</strong> indicates how MIDI note velocity affects the
sound. When this control is set to its minimum value, velocity affects
cutoff frequency (the harder the key is pressed, the more open the
filter is). When this control is set to its maximum value, velocity
affects VCA level (the harder the key is pressed, the louder the sound
is). In the middle position, velocity has no effect on sound.</p>
<h3 id="latch-and-hold-jamming-without-midi-keyboard">Latch and hold, jamming without MIDI keyboard</h3>
<p>While some keys are pressed on the MIDI keyboard, press the <strong>Hold</strong>
button to keep them held. LEDs will be temporarily dimmed. Press
<strong>Hold</strong> again to release them. This can be used as a "latch" function
for the arpeggiator, freeing your hands to tweak the knobs while an
arpeggio is being held... or simply to create a drone tone.</p>
<p>The <strong>Hold</strong> function hides another mystery... Even if Anushri has been
designed as a MIDI synth module, it is still possible to play it without
an external keyboard or sequencer. Hold the <strong>Hold</strong> button for 2
seconds. A note starts playing. Turn the 5 knobs on the last row to step
through scales. Press the <strong>Hold</strong> button again to leave this mode.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../static/images/anushri_panel_scales.png" /></p>
<p>This "knob jamming" mode can even be triggered while the sequencer is
recording, and provides a fun way of letting your toddlers, pets or
significant other input random but musically coherent (or not)
sequences.</p>
<h2 id="drum-synth-and-generative-drum-machine">Drum synth and generative drum machine</h2>
<h3 id="overview_1">Overview</h3>
<p>Anushri has a built-in drum synth and generative drum sequencer which
can be played along with the synth section and its
arpeggiator/sequencer.</p>
<p>The drum synth comprises three parts, for bass drum (BD), snare drum
(SD), and closed high-hat (HH). The bass drum and snare drum sounds are
generated digitally, using a pitch and amplitude modulated digital
oscillator and a noise source. The high-hat uses sample playback with
variable speed, and an amplitude envelope.</p>
<p>The drum machine is playing when the sequencer is running. If you want
to play freely (or with the arpeggiator) on top of the drum machine,
record an empty sequence - <strong>Rec</strong>, <strong>Rec</strong> - and press <strong>Run/stop</strong> to
start the drum machine.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-the-generative-sequencer">Understanding the generative sequencer</h3>
<p>The sequencer controlling the drum section is unlike anything else. It
is neither based on x0x-style step programming, nor on presets. It is
mostly played by knobs. How does it work? Let us introduce two concepts.</p>
<h4 id="style-map">Style map</h4>
<p>One sleepless night, you have the crazy idea of tiling the floor of your
apartment with your CD collection. You start taking the CDs and putting
them on the floor, and then, come up with the idea of grouping them
"stylistically"... Wouldn't it be great if CDs of bands that sound
similar would be laid out close to each other? All the old-school Techno
up north, hip-hop south, with maybe some big-beat of trip-hop in the
middle, and an island of jazz on the east. What's great with this
arrangement, where objects physically close to each other are sonically
related to each other, is that tracing a path through the space would
leave a continuous playlist with interesting transitions from one artist
to the other...</p>
<p>Now imagine doing the same thing with the collection of drum loops on
your hard-drive... All variants of the Amen break would be clustered
together, farther apart from the 909 house loops.</p>
<p>There are indeed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map">mathematical
techniques</a> to do this
kind of arrangements and this is exactly how Anushri stores and
organizes drum patterns. In the darkness of the Mutable Instruments
labs, we have compiled many drum patterns, tiled them into a 2D map so
that nearby patterns occupy nearby cells.</p>
<p>What's the point of doing this? It allows an efficient way of
"nagivating" through a large collection of rhythms with just two
parameters: the X and Y coordinates on the map. Each rhythm from the
original set is referenced by an X and Y position, and changing the
coordinates transitions progressively to different, but still related
sounding rhythms. It has nothing to do with the incongruous "jumps" one
would hear by scrolling through a bank of presets or a list of drum
loops files. It allows efficient data compression too - since many
similar patterns end up in clusters at the same coordinates, we can pick
one single representative in the group and ditch the others...</p>
<h4 id="note-additionremoval-lists-and-event-density">Note addition/removal lists and event density</h4>
<p>From the previous section, you have learnt that Anushri stores a map of
drum patterns, organized by similarity, and addressed by X and Y
coordinates. What is stored is indeed more complicated than a x0x-like
pattern with on and off LEDs...</p>
<p>I'm sure you have already done this... Switch on your 808 (or clone),
add a kick on the first step. Then on the 9th. Then on the 5th and 13th
to get a four-to-the-floor pattern. Then on the 15th or 16th to add some
more variations at the end of the bar... And then the snare... It starts
with a simple hit on the 5th or 13th step (or both)... And then maybe a
more complex pattern with the 2nd and 8th steps involved to add a
syncopated feel. By analyzing such "build-ups" we can make a list of
steps by order of importance. For the kick in a techno/house rhythm, the
first beat is important, it shouldn't be missing... Closely followed by
the 9th and 5th and 13th, and then maybe the 15th or 16th... Experts
might or might not agree, but we don't need their opinion... By
collecting a large dataset of rhythms, it is possible to compile
statistics to answer the following question: "given this drum pattern,
if we were to add a bass drum note to it, what would be the most logical
position where it would appear"? We can do the operation the other way
round: "Given this drum pattern, if we were to remove a bass drum note
from it, which one would it be?". This question is easily answered by
statistics: take a database of MIDI drum loops, take a pattern, and
search for all the occurrences of drum patterns that differ by only one
note. What has been added or removed? By iterating the process, we can
build the list of steps, sorted by priority, which should be added to a
pattern to enrich it - or removed from it to simplify it.</p>
<p>This is the second ingredient! Anushri stores a 2D map of such note
addition/removal lists. The X and Y coordinates on the map identify an
overall "genre" in which the drum pattern will be performed. Then, by
stepping through the note addition/removal lists for BD, SD and HH, we
can make the drum pattern more dense or more sparse for each of those
instruments. This is expressed by 3 parameters called BD, SD and HH
density. When these parameters are increased, we zip through the note
addition list to make the pattern richer and richer. When these
parameters are decreased, we go backwards through the note removal list,
to make the pattern sparser and sparser. It's a bit like creating a
simple drum pattern in your sequencer, then micro-polishing it to hell
with ghost notes and variations... and then stepping through the undo
and redo commands to move back and forth between its simpler self and
the drill'n'bass monster it has become.</p>
<p>A last thing: representing drum patterns with note addition/removal
lists allows very easily to add meaningful random variations. Play a
drum pattern. You want to spice things up a bit? Just look for the next
entry (or pair of entries) in the note addition list - it'll tell you
where to add this extra snare roll or kick hit. Anushri's drum sequencer
has this randomness built-in - it never really repeats itself!</p>
<p>Let's summarize all of this. Anushri generates drum patterns and put you
in control of the:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sparsity/density of the BD, SD and HH tracks, allowing immediate
    simplification or elaboration of the pattern played by each drum
    instrument.</li>
<li>X, Y coordinates of the base "pattern", with many drum patterns
    organized by similarity in a 2D map. These patterns are not actual
    "presets" or x0x type grids, but rather note addition/removal lists
    for the sparsity/density controls.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this all sounds complicated to you, here is a final analogy:
Anushri's approach of sculpting drum patterns is to a x0x what
subtractive synthesis is to additive synthesis. Instead of building
everything from scratch, you enrich or simplify/filter basic drum
patterns, just like you filter rich waveforms on a subtractive synth
instead of building them up from scratch with harmonics.</p>
<h3 id="drum-machine-controls">Drum machine controls</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../../static/images/anushri_panel_drums.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Map X</strong> and <strong>Map Y</strong> control the coordinates of the drum pattern on
the style map.</p>
<p><strong>BD density</strong>, <strong>SD density</strong> and <strong>HH density</strong> indicate how
sparse/dense the pattern is in terms of these elements.</p>
<p><strong>BD / SD</strong> adjusts the relative level of the BD and SD+HH sound
generators. When turned left, the BD dominates; when turned right, the
SD and HH dominate.</p>
<p><strong>BD tone</strong> controls the tone of the bass drum, by morphing through the
following sounds: subdued 808-like kick, stronger 909-like kick, deeper
909-like kick, long decay 808-like kick, noisy industrial kick.</p>
<p><strong>SD tone</strong> controls the tone of the snare drum, by morphing through the
following sounds: short 606-like snare, snappy 909-like snare, higher
and higher pitched 808-like snare, zap!</p>
<p><strong>HH tone</strong> controls the tone of the high-hat, by increasing the pitch
of the sound, and increasing, then lowering the decay time.</p>
<p><strong>Bandwidth</strong> controls the sample rate of the drum synth. Think of it as
an 8-bit poor man's filter...</p>
<p>Note that the tone generator is quite lo-fi! Since it uses 8-bit
precision with PWM conversion, the BD signal exhibits significant noise
when the amplitude decreases (a Mirage or an Amiga did it, too), and the
noise floor is quite high. External processing of this signal through
EQ, filters or noise gates is recommended, and is facilitated by the
individual drums output on the front panel.</p>
<p>It is worth observing that if the drum machine section is not used,
Anushri's noise floor can be significantly improved by plugging a jack
into the <strong>Drums out</strong> output to take out of the mix some of the
background noise coming out of the processor.</p>

<h3 id="system-configuration">System configuration</h3>
<h4 id="midi-channel-selection">MIDI channel selection</h4>
<p>To select which MIDI channel Anushri will respond to, hold <strong>Hold</strong> and
press the <strong>Synth</strong> button, then play a note on the MIDI channel you
want it to respond to. Note that the active MIDI channel is indicated by
a combination of LEDs:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../static/images/anushri_channel_select.png" /></p>
<h4 id="midi-out-message-filter">MIDI out message filter</h4>
<p>Hold <strong>Hold</strong> and press the <strong>Kbd/Clk</strong> button to select the messages
that Anushri sends to the MIDI out. The LED temporarily displays the
message types which are enabled/disabled for transmission. Pressing the
switches activates or deactivates those messages.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../static/images/anushri_midi_modes_cheatsheet.png" /></p>
<p>When the <strong>Thru</strong> LED is lit, incoming MIDI messages are forwarded to
the MIDI out.</p>
<p>When the <strong>Arp/Seq</strong> LED is lit, the note events generated by the
sequencer and arpeggiator are sent to the MIDI out (for example to
trigger external gear using Anushri's arpeggiator and sequencer).</p>
<p>When the <strong>Drums</strong> LED is lit, the note events generated by the drum
pattern generator are sent to the MIDI out, on channel 10 (for example
to trigger an external drum module).</p>
<p>When the <strong>Clock</strong> LED is lit, the start/stop and clock events driving
Anushri's sequencer are sent to the MIDI out.</p>
<h4 id="clock-resolution">Clock resolution</h4>
<p>Hold <strong>Hold</strong> and press the <strong>Drums</strong> button to change the resolution of
Anushri's clock system.</p>

<h4 id="x0x-style-programming-of-the-drum-machine">x0x-style programming of the drum machine</h4>
<p>If maps and densities are not your thing, there is still a way of
entirely overriding the generative drum machine and program x0x patterns
into it! This is done through a MIDI keyboard sending notes on MIDI
channel 16.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../static/images/anushri_x0x_cheatsheet.png" /></p>
<p>The lowest C# key (on a 61 notes keyboard) is used to enable or disable
the generative drum machine, with the programmed x0x pattern taking
over. The D# key clears the pattern programmed for the current
instrument. The F# / G# / A# keys select the instrument to program.
Finally the white keys are used for activating/deactivating notes at
each of the 16 steps.</p>
<h4 id="sysex-backup">SysEx Backup</h4>
<p>Hold <strong>Run/stop</strong> for a few seconds to request a SysEx dump of all
internal settings. The resulting data (or chunks of it) can be be sent
to Anushri at later time to restore its settings.</p>
<h3 id="firmware-update">Firmware update</h3>
<p>Keep the <strong>Hold</strong> key pressed while Anushri is powered on to put it into
firmware update mode. Every second LED will be lit. The unit is now
ready to receive the update data, which can be sent as a SysEx file
(with a 250ms or more delay between packets) or as a MIDIfile. The LEDs
blink on every received packet. The update takes about 1 minute, and can
be restarted in case of accidental interruption. Upon reception of the
last packet, the unit immediately boots with the new firmware.</p>
<p>If you want to use a dedicated SysEx transfer tool rather than a
sequencer, we recommend <a href="http://www.elektron.se/support-and-downloads">Elektron's C6

additional piece of information about what to do with the data.</p>
<p><strong>Payload</strong> is a sequence of bytes in nibblized form. For example, the
sequence <code>0x80 0x56 0x13</code> is transmitted as
<code>0x08 0x00 0x05 0x06 0x01 0x03</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Checksum</strong> is equal to the nibblized-sum, modulo 256, of the bytes. In

<p>When Anushri receives a SysEx block with <strong>command</strong> equal to 0x11,
<strong>argument</strong> equal to 0x00, and an empty payload, it spits a full SysEx
dump of its memory, made of five SysEx packets (command/argument equal
to 0x01 0x00, 0x01 0x01, 0x01 0x02, 0x01 0x03 and 0x01 0x04).</p>
